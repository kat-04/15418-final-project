                            <h2>Summary</h2>
							<p>We will be implementing different parallel implementations of Conway’s Game of Life in 3D. We will be
                                using the NVIDIA GPUs on the GHC machines for our CUDA implementation and the PSC machines
                                for the OpenMP implementation.</p>
                            <h2>Background</h2>
                            <p>Conway’s Game of Life is a Turing complete zero-player cellular automaton, traditionally in 2D, that
                                simulates basic evolution. After giving an initial configuration of alive or dead cells, the pattern evolves
                                based on a set number of rules governed by the neighbors of each cell:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>A cell with <h:math><= 1</h:math> living neighbors <i>(underpopulation)</i></li>
                                <li>A cell with <h:math>>= 4</h:math> living neighbors dies <i>(overpopulation)</i></li>
                                <li>An empty cell with exactly 3 living neighbors becomes alive <i>(reproduction)</i></li>
                            </ol>
                            <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/oscillatorExample.jpg" alt="" /></span>Despite this basic ruleset, there have been many different types of patterns found through studies: still lifes, which do not move; oscillators, which have a periodic form of motion; and spaceships, which drift in a consistent manner across space. Some initial patterns can also lead to infinite growth, where the bounding box of the pattern grows at each timestep. One example of a basic oscillator is shown to the right.</p>
                            <p>Conway's Game of Life is fairly simple in 2D, as there are only 8 neighbors and 2 axes (x- and y-axis). However, adapting to 3D -- increasing the number of neighbors from 8 to 26 and multiplying the size of the grid by another factor -- greatly increases communication intensity. Furthermore, the z-axis can now be an added area of parallelism.</p>
                            <p>Another area for potential speedup is the idea converging or stable structures that form in Conway's Game of Life. In the 2D model, all starting states gradually converged to stable structures. Similarly, in 3D, all starting states will also generally remain stable after a certain time, meaning that there will be no need to pass information about empty spaces around unless they are immediate neighbors.</p>
                            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                            <p>As stated previously, scaling to 3D increases the areas of parallelism and the achievable theoretical speedup. By increasing the number of dimensions, we increase the number of neighbors (8 to 26), meaning we must do more than 3 times as much communication. Furthermore, the number of cells increase from N^2 to N^3, potentially creating a memory constraint if N becomes large enough.</p>
                            <p>The main workload of this project revolves around managing locality. Since all computation relies on the state of the neighbors of a cell at any given time, our project has a very high communication-to-computation ratio.</p>
                            <p>There are also constraints to the workload. There are many possible patterns that the cellular structures can stably converge to, as the cells tend to group around their immediate neighbors. This situation immediately gives rise to the possibility of workload imbalance, as areas with alive cells will need to communicate more than areas with only dead cells (note how all the rules for 2D Conway's Game of Life are based on the number of alive neighbors). </p>
                            <h2>Resources</h2>
                            <p>Some basic aspects of our projects 2 (CUDA) and 3 (OpenMP) are naturally similar due to their methods of parallelism, so we will use them as reference. Our past assignments using CUDA kernels and OpenMP pragmas for 2D programs will help us extend our knowledge to a 3D program. </p>
                            <p>We have also found a couple of online resources that will be useful. The first website <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs195v/projects/life/edwallac/index.html">here</a> describes some interesting extensions of the original ruleset for the 3D version. Another website  <a href="https://shankarrajagopal.github.io/DOWNLOAD/CG_LAB_P3.pdf">here</a> provides a useful guide to rendering in OpenGL, which we would like to build upon to render our results.</p>
                            <h2>Goals and Deliverables</h2>
                            <h3>Plan to Achieve</h3>
                            <p>We expect to achieve the following tasks within the time frame. Note that all three implementations should output their results in a common text format so that we can judge correctness and easily render results. </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><u>Sequential Implementation</u> - a naive, sequential implementation of the 3D Game of Life that can be used as a comparison to our parallel implementations. </li>
                                <li><u>Parallel CUDA Implementation</u> - a parallel implementation of the 3D Game of Life in CUDA that achieves significant speedup in comparison to our sequential version. It should work to minimize computation and workload imbalance. </li>
                                <li><u>Parallel OpenMP Implementation</u> - a parallel implementation of the 3D Game of Life in OpenMP that achieves significant speedup in comparison to our sequential version. Similarly, it should work to minimize computation and workload imbalance.</li>
                                <li><u>Visualizations for Debugging Purposes in OpenGL</u> - a basic, non-interactive renderer of our output data that visualizes the cube and each simulation step. This is an important step to ensure correctness of our implementations and it allows for visual debugging.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <h3>Hope to Achieve</h3>
                            <p>While not strictly necessary for this project, we would like to achieve some of the following as well.</p>
