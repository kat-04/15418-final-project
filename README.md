## Brief Description for HTML

index.html -- This is the initial site (the front page) -- It's what I edited to include the pictures.

generic.html -- This is a sample html for the generic pages (linked through the "Details" buttons in the "Process" category. We probably want to create copies of those and link separate ones per button. I have no clue how to embed a pdf but we can try doing that?)

elements.html -- not sure what this one is, but we can figure it out.

assets/ -- this folder contains all the CSS/JS related items (that I do not understand)
